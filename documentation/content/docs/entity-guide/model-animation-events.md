# {{% param "title" %}}

* The model animations in Half-Life can have *events* attached to specific frames.
* Data-wise event is just a number with optional *options* string.
* In the game events are different effects played along with the model animation when it reaches the frame the event resides on.
* The events are handled and processed by the game logic. Entity implementations are responsible for handling the events, but there's a number of shared events, recognized by all monster entities.

The incomplete list of shared events:

* `1004` - play a sound provided in the *options* data of the event on the *body* channel and *idle* attenuation.
* `1008` - play a sound provided in the *options* data of the event on the *voice* channel and *idle* attenuation.
* `1011` - play a sound provided in the *options* data of the event on the *body* channel and *norm* attenuation. Opposing Force compatible.
* `1012` - play a sound provided in the *options* data of the event on the *voice* channel and *norm* attenuation. Opposing Force compatible.
* `1013` - play a sound provided in the *options* data of the event on the *weapon* channel and *norm* attenuation. Opposing Force compatible.
* `1014` - play a soundscript provided in the *options* data of the event. Featureful SDK specific.
* `2001` - play the `NPC.BodyDrop_Light` soundscript.
* `2002` - play the `NPC.BodyDrop_Heavy` soundscript.
* ![](/images/svencoop.png) `2003` - play footstep sound matching the material type set for the map textures.
* `2010` - play the `NPC.SwishSound` soundscript.

## Clientside events

The events 5000 and above are considered to be clientside events - they're playing on client. These are used by weapon viewmodels for playing muzzle flashes and sounds.

New client animation events introduced in Featureful SDK:

* `5005` - muzzleflash on the first attachment. This is practically the same as event 5001 with the event options set to `31`. This is currently a stub for Sven Co-op weapon models. In Sven Co-op the options for event `5005` refer to the txt file that defines the muzzleflash properties. The support for such files might be implemented later.
