# ![](/images/alpha.png) monster_archer

An archer fish - an alien creature cut from Half-Life. Designed similar to how it's made in the mods Thrill and Reprocessing, but also supports the original model available in Half-Life.

The monster utilizes the melee (bite) attack and the short range lightning attack.

### Skill variables

* **sk_archer_health** - monster's health.
* **sk_archer_dmg_bite** - bite damage.
* **sk_archer_dmg_zap** - zap damage (unlike Thrill where the damage is applied twice, this will be applied once).
* **sk_archer_delay_zap** - the minimum delay before the next attack after using a zap attack. This is `[2.5, 7.0]` range by default.

### Default classification

`Alien Monster`

### Default display name

`Archer`

### Soundscripts

* **Archer.Idle** - idle sounds. Empty by default.
* **Archer.Alert** - alert sounds. Also played when Archer is charging at its enemy. Uses unused ichthyosaur alert sound by default (with slightly higher pitch).
* **Archer.Pain** - pain sounds. Uses unused ichthyosaur pain sound by default (with slightly higher pitch).
* **Archer.Die** - death sounds. Uses unused ichthyosaur death sounds by default (with slightly higher pitch).
* **Archer.Bite** - trying to bite an enemy. Uses unused bullsquid bite sound by default.
* **Archer.ZapPowerup** - starting zap attack.
* **Archer.Electro** - played at the end of ligtning.

### Visuals

* **Archer.ZapBeam** - zap beam.
* **Archer.PowerupLight** - an entity light created when the archer starts powering its zap attack. This is either played on the first attachment (if the model has one) or in front of the monster's center.
* **Archer.ZapLight** - an entity light created at the moment of zap attack (when beam is created). This is either played on the first attachment (if the model has one) or in front of the monster's center.

### Attacks

* *Melee Attack 1* - bite.
* *Range Attack 1* - beam attack (if the sequence with such activity is missing it uses `shoot` animation).

### Animation events

* `1` - bite attack.
* `2` - zap attack.
* `3` - same as `2`, to support the model from Thrill and Reprocessing.
