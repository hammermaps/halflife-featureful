### Entity template examples

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "Trace Attack rules" %}}
The [trace attack]({{< ref "entity-templates/#trace_attack" >}}) rules that emulate monster's native ones. Could be used as a starting point for further changes.

{{% hint info %}}
Opposing Force human grunt model doesn't actually have hitgroup 11. If you want to enable the helmet protection behavior, you must change the model and add a filter for the body group (so only helmet variations would have an additional protection) similarly to how it's implemented in [monster_human_grunt]({{% ref monster_human_grunt %}}) trace attack rules.
