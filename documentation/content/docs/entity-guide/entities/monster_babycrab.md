### Entity template examples

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "Opaque babycrab" %}}
By default babycrabs have a bit of transparency in them. This template makes them opaque and also sets a smaller gib scale, because it's weird they produce gibs as big as other monsters.
```json
{
    "monster_babycrab": {
        "own_visual": {
            "rendermode": "normal"
        },
        "gib_visual": {

        }
    },
}
