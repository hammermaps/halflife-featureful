# monster_bullchicken (aka Bullsquid)

[TWHL](https://twhl.info/wiki/page/monster_bullchicken)

### Changes

* Spit projectile precision depends on difficulty level (**sk_bullsquid_spit_inaccuracy** skill value).
* Can spit an alternative projectile - the slow poisonous ball. Depends on **sk_bullsquid_toxicity** skill value.
* Restores health when eating.

{{% hint warning %}}
If you don't want a new bullsquid's projectile attack put the following entry in your **skill.cfg**:

```
sk_bullsquid_toxicity 0
```
{{% /hint %}}

### Skill variables

* **sk_bullsquid_health** - monster's health.
* **sk_bullsquid_dmg_bite** - bite damage.
* **sk_bullsquid_dmg_whip** - tail whip damage.
* **sk_bullsquid_dmg_spit** - acid spit damage.
* **sk_bullsquid_toxicity** - whether bullsquids can use toxic spit attack. Default values: 0 on easy, 1 on medium and hard.
* **sk_bullsquid_dmg_toxic_poison** - the poison damage of the toxic spit. By default it's **sk_bullsquid_dmg_spit** multiplied by 0.25.
* **sk_bullsquid_dmg_toxic_impact** - the impact damage of the toxic spit. By default it's **sk_bullsquid_dmg_spit** multiplied by 1.5.
* **sk_bullsquid_spit_inaccuracy** - the spit inaccuracy in unspecified units. The higher value means the worse accuracy. Default values: 5 on Easy, 3 on Medium, 1 on Hard. 0 means the perfect accuracy. In original Half-Life the inaccuracy worked as if it had value 5 regardless of difficulty.
