So, you want to create a new mod or port an existing one using Featureful SDK.

## Download the mod sample and prepare your mod directory

1. Grab the archive with the mod sample from the [Releases](https://github.com/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful/releases) (download the associated halflife_featureful zip asset). Install it like you install other mods, i.e. unpack the archive into your Half-Life directory, so the **featureful** directory ends up being a subdirectory of Half-Life directory.
2. Create a directory for your own mod (if you haven't done that yet). See also: [TWHL article on setting up a mod](https://twhl.info/wiki/page/Tutorial:_Setting_up_a_Mod:_Part_1_-_Mod_directory_and_liblist.gam_(Steam))
3. Copy **cl_dlls/**, **dlls/**, **delta.lst** and optionally **events/** and **features/** from the **featureful** directory to your mod directory. You may copy **templates/** as well, but it contains many configuration files that serve mostly as examples so you don't need them.
4. Copy **liblist.gam** as well and edit it to give a different `game` name. If you have previously created liblist.gam in your mod directory, make sure `gamedll` refers to `dlls/hl.dll`.
5. Alternatively, instead of doing 2-3 you can just rename the **featureful** directory to something else and edit **liblist.gam** afterwards. Note that the sample mod includes some resources and configuration files you may not need, so it's better to start with your own mod directory and then copy only necessary things.
6. In your mod directory go to the **features/** subdirectory and start adjusting features as described below.

{{% hint warning %}}
**DO NOT** develop your mod in the **featureful** directory. Choose a different name for your mod directory. This will save you from risks of replacing your files when you install a new version of the sample mod. You can do some experiments and tests in the sample mod but don't treat it as a playground for your own work.

## Feature configuration

The main point of Featureful SDK is being configurable via a set of configuration files. 

You can configure various aspects of the game by editing the configuration files in **features/** directory (e.g. change the default HUD color or change the light source provided by suit from flashlight to NVG). Read [Feature configuration]({{< ref "configuration" >}}) about the files format.

## Enabling custom weapons

Decide which of the available weapons you want to include in your mod. Based on that you should copy all required resources to your mod either from the mod sample or other sources (e.g. from gearbox/ folder of Opposing Force). The resources vary depending on the weapon and usually include:

* Models (`v_`, `p_` and `w_`)
* HUD sprites and .txt file describing the weapon hud (e.g. weapon_eagle.txt)
* Projectile sprites and models (for some weapons, e.g. shock rifle, spore launcher)
* Sounds
* `events/*.sc` file (currently needed by displacer, medkit and penguin).
* Additional skill variables in skill.cfg.

Open **features/featureful_weapons.cfg** in your mod directory and configure the list of enabled custom weapons.

## Enabling custom monsters

Decide which of available non-standard Half-Life monsters you want to be use in the mod. Monsters need new resources to be included in the mod directory.

* Models (the monster's model itself; sometimes gibs and projectiles)
* Sounds
* Sprites (visual effects related to the monster)
* Additional skill cvars in skill.cfg
* Some monsters need additional entries in the `sound/sentences.txt`. E.g. Otis needs sentences with `OT_`prefix.

Open **features/featureful_monsters.cfg** in your mod directory and configure the list of enabled monsters.

## Configuring server-side features

You can edit some server-side features via **features/featureful_server.cfg**. The file provided in the mod sample directory contains comments describing the features, so we don't go into detail on each feature here.

There's also a **features/featureful_exec.cfg** file which is getting executed by the engine and needs to be in the regular `.cfg` format (like server.cfg or skill.cfg). In this file you can set some cvars to values specific for your mod for features that are currently implemented as cvars only (e.g. `pushablemode` cvar).

Read some [recommendations]({{< ref "configuration.md/#recommendations" >}}) on configuring the mod.

## Configuring client-side features

You can edit some client-side features via **features/featureful_client.cfg**. The file provided in the mod sample directory contains comments describing the features, so we don't go into detail on each feature here.
