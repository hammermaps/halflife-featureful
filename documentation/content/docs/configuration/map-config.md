# {{% param "title" %}}

Featureful SDK allows maps to have the config file listing the starting equipment given to the player and some other player settings when the map is started via `map` console command or via the *New game* menu dialog. The equipment won't be given if player entered the map via the `trigger_changelevel`.

In the **maps** directory create a file with a name like **mapname.cfg** where the `mapname` is a name of the map file (without **.bsp** extension).

{{% hint info %}}
The sole presence of map config file makes the game to give player a suit. Set `nosuit` option to avoid it.

You can also configure the starting equipment on the map itself, via [game_player_settings]({{< ref game_player_settings >}}) entity. This however requires map rebuilding if you want to make changes.

## Format

Each piece of equipment is defined by one line in the file.

* `starthealth` - specify the starting health.
* `maxhealth` - maximum player's health.
* `maxarmor` - maximum player's armor.
* `deploy` - the classname of the weapon to deploy. By default the best weapon (the one with the highest priority) is deployed.

Example:

```
